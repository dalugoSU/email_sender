## email_sender
Simplistic GUI to send simple emails through gmail.

## Using the GUI
### In order to use an email with this GUI, you have to either:
- Enable less secure apps on the email you plan on using on the GUI
or
- Enable two step verification -> Search App passwords -> Log in -> Select App (mail) -> select device (windows computer) -> Click generate. That code will be your password log in. Save it. If you lose it, you will have to generate a new one.
